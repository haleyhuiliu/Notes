What I have to prepare:

- [ ] Resume
- [ ] GitHub link
- [ ] Personal website link
- [ ] Referrers

Phone interview:
- [ ] 45 mins
- [ ] Coding on a Google Doc
- [ ] Greetings
- [ ] May cover anything on my resume
- [ ] Write algorithms and analyze complexity

How to answer coding questions:
- [ ] Read the question
- [ ] If don't understant some words, please ask
- [ ] Ask clarifications
- [ ] State assumptions
- [ ] Speak out while I am thinking
- [ ] Analyze the complexity, explain with Big-O analysis of running-time complexity
- [ ] Right before providing the solution, please double check the assumptions/edge cases, add tests
- [ ] If stuck, don't cry

How to practice:
- [ ] Coding on a Google Doc or a whiteboard
- [ ] Time myself during practice

My code should be 
- [ ] Clean
- [ ] Without typing mistakes
- [ ] Bug-free
- [ ] Properly handles edge cases

For the following concepts, please ask 4 questions for each of them.
1. What is it? 
2. How to implement it? 
3. What is the complexity? access? search? insertion? deletion? space? [cheatsheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
4. Pros? Cons? tradeoffs?
